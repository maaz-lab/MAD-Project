//             "KARACHI: Legal and electoral experts have differing opinions on the Supreme Court’s Saturday verdict, some seeing it as a blow to the rights of voters while others terming it a consequence of the PTI not offering enough legal argument during the proceedings. Talking to The News on Saturday night, PILDAT President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob said: “The PTI focussed on political considerations in the case and almost ignored legal and constitutional grounds. Since courts are a legal forum, political arguments didn’t cut much ice.” According to him, “The SC judgment is obviously a major setback for the party. The real loss is in the form of deprivation of 226 reserved seats including 60 in NA. This robs the party of its chance, if at all there was any, to come to power but parties do fall and rise again.”",
